Project objective :
The main objective is to analyze Airbnb data to understand traveler preferences, the
factors that influence accommodation pricing, and propose recommendations to
maximize listing visibility.


Setting the scene :
1. Airbnb Listing Data:
- Download Airbnb listing data for your target city.
- Explore columns such as "price", "number of rooms", "comments", etc.
2. Neighborhood information (Webscraping) :
- Use webscraping to gather information about neighborhoods such as local
attractions, restaurants, safety indicators, must-do/see...
3. Public transport data (API Open Data) :
- Integrate public transport data from APIs to assess the accessibility of
neighborhoods/attractions from major public transport stations.
4. User comments (NoSQL database) :
- Store user comments in a NoSQL database. Use queries to extract information on
traveler preferences and areas for improvement for each accommodation type.
5. Global Analysis :

- Merge these data sources to analyze trends in the Airbnb accommodation
market, identify factors influencing prices, and assess the impact of amenities and
accessibility.
6. Recommendations:
- Make recommendations to optimize Airbnb listings based on traveler
preferences, neighborhood characteristics, and user feedback. This can include
suggestions for adjusting prices, improving listing descriptions, or adding popular
amenities.
This holistic approach will enable your company to better understand the Airbnb
accommodation market, optimize its offerings and improve the overall traveler
experience.
